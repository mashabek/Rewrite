# Rewrite 📝✨

Tired of bouncing between your work and online grammar checkers? Rewrite will help ya. It's like having a writing assistant right on your desktop, ready to polish your text with just a hotkey. 

I have been using it for my personal needs. Before large language models, I utilized AI translators with multiple round trips, as I found they did a decent job of rewriting text. With the capabilities of large language models, the process can be taken even further. My main point is we all have LLM subscriptions and I stongly believe we should utilize them as much as we can.
